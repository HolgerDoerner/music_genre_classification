## About
To get innto machine learning I needed a small project, so I decided to try sentiment analysis and text classification. From the beginning this was meant as a full-stack project, with the trained model in the backend and a single-page-application for the frontend.

## The Data
As datasource I downloaded a dataset from [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) which contains over 380.000 lyrics with metadata like artist, song name, year and also the genre. There were lyrics in serveral languages, but I only needed the english ones.
